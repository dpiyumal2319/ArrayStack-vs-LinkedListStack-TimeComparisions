- GNU Make (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the program using the provided Makefile or manually using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage

Run the compiled executable to generate an `output.txt` file containing the performance metrics for the stack operations.
